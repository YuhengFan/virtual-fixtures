Virtual-Fixtures
==============

A set of ROS packages to create and interact with a library of virtual guides.

------
## What ?

Virtual guides constrain the robot movement along task-relevant trajectories.
To do an analogy with the real world, a virtual guide can be compared to a ruler which can be used to draw streight lines with minimal effort.
These packages allow you to create a library of guides (i.e. multiple guides working in parallel) and to select the guide to use through an intuitive haptic interaction. (video)

## Why ?

Virtual guides can be used in a co-manipulation context where humans and robots work togheter to complete different kind of tasks. As well known, the co-manipulation combines the advantages of humans (abstract task understanding, robust
perception) with the advantages of an industrial robot (accuracy, strength).
By using virtual guides we can facilitate the joint completion of a task where the advantages of both are required.
