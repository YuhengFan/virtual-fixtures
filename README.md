Virtual-Fixtures
==============

A set of ROS packages to create and interact with a library of virtual guides.

------
## What ?

Virtual guides constrain the robot movement along task-relevant trajectories.
To do an analogy with the real world, a virtual guide can be compared to a ruler which can be used to draw straight lines with minimal effort.
These packages allow you to create a library of guides (i.e. multiple guides working in parallel) and to choose the guide to use through an intuitive haptic interaction. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8xCxh6U_yg)

------
## Why ?

Virtual guides can be used in a co-manipulation context where humans and robots work togheter to complete different kind of tasks. As well known, industrial robots have a good accuracy and strength but they lack the capacity of abstract thinking and they don't (usually) posses a good perception.
By using the virtual guides it is possible to combine the advantages of an industrial robot with the smartness of a human worker, in order to facilitate the joint completion of a task.
