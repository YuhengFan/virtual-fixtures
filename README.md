Virtual-Fixtures
==============

A set of ROS packages to create and interact with a library of virtual guides.

------
## What ?

Virtual guides constrain the robot movement along task-relevant trajectories.
To do an analogy with the real world, a virtual guide can be compared to a ruler which can be used to draw straight lines with minimal effort.
These packages allow you to create a library of guides (i.e. multiple guides working in parallel) and to choose the guide to use through an intuitive haptic interaction. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8xCxh6U_yg)

------
## Why ?

Virtual guides can be used in a co-manipulation context where humans and robots work togheter to complete different kind of tasks. As well known, industrial robots have a good accuracy and strength but they lack flexibility in terms of abstract thinking and perception, while humans excel in both things.
By using the virtual guides it is possible to combine the advantages of both in order to facilitate the joint completion of a task.
